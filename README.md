Code samples and simple programs that work in SuperCollider

I'm taking MUSC 115, Intro to Sound Design, this quarter (fall 2013).
We are using a program called SuperCollider to make sounds.

Check out my professor's code here: sccode.org/bruno

These are some code chunks and simple programs that you can run with SuperCollider.

If you have SuperCollider, open the \*.scd file and:
- ctrl (Apple) + b to boot server
- ctrl (Apple) + enter to run code
- ctrl (Apple) + . to stop all sounds

Feel free to contact me with any questions.
